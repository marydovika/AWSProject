AWS-Implies Automatic Weather Stations
Automatic Weather Stations (AWS) play a critical  role in environmental monitoring, yet their deployment in remote and energy-constrained locations remains limited by rigid and monolithic power architectures. 
Conventional systems are often designed for single enrgy sources, leading to inefficiencies, frequent power interruptions, high maintenance costs, and poor adaptability to dynamic environmental conditions. 
This research proposes the development of a modular and adaptive power electronics system architecture tailered for energy-constrained AWS.
The modular design introduces swappable converter topologies that allow scalable integration of multiple renewable energy sources, including solar, batteries, and supercapacitors, while simplifying upgrades, repairs, and fault isolation. Complementing this, an adaptive control strategy will be implemented to dynamically optimize power flow in response to load variations, source intermittency, and environmental disturbances, thereby enhancing system stability and efficiency. 
The study will involve system design, simulation, and prototype development, followed by performance evaluation under varying operating conditions.
Expected outcomes include improved energy efficiency, fault tolerance, and operational autonomy, ensuring more reliable and sustainable weather data collection in resource-limited and off-grid regions. 
The findings of this research will contribute to advancing resilient power system solutions that support agriculture, public safety, infrastructure planning, and climate research.
